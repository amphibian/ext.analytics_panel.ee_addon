**Google Analytics Panel** adds an overview of your site's Google Analytics statistics to a panel on the ExpressionEngine control panel home screen. The panel displays quick stats for Today and Yesterday (visits, pageviews, average pageviews per visit, and average visit length), with increased stats for the past 31 days (visits, pageviews, average pageviews per visit, average visit length, bounce rate, percentage of new visits, top content and top referrers). The 31-day stats also include sparklines to visualize site activity. It's all very pretty really.

##Installation

Upload the Analytics panel extension and language file to **/system/extensions/** and **/system/language/english/** respectively. Then upload the included **lib/analytics_panel** folder to your **/system/lib/** directory.

Activate the extension, then visit the Google Analytics Panel settings screen. Enter your Google Analytics username and password and click Submit. Load the settings screen again, and choose the profile you wish to display on the home screen.

The Google Analytics panel will now be available on the **My Account -> Customize Control Panel -> Control Panel Homepage** screen for each user, and can be set to display in either the left or right column, and ordered just like the default homepage panels.

Now load your home screen and cry/smile at how un/popular your site is.

##Compatibility

Google Analytics Panel is MSM-compatible and has been tested with ExpressionEngine 1.6.8. **Requires PHP 5.**
